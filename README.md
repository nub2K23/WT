Below is a clean, well-structured **README.md** you can drop into a lab folder containing HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP code. If you want it customized to a specific project name or instructions, just tell me!

# **Lab Project – HTML, CSS, JavaScript & PHP**

This repository contains a lab exercise demonstrating the integration of **front-end** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and **back-end** (PHP) web technologies. The code in this folder is intended to help you understand how these components work together to build a functional web application.

## **🧰 Technologies Used**

### **Frontend**

- **HTML5** – Structure and content layout
- **CSS3** – Styling, layout design, and responsiveness
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Interactivity and dynamic behavior

### **Backend**

- **PHP** – Server-side processing, handling forms, backend logic

## **🚀 How to Run the Project**

Since this project includes **PHP**, it must be run on a server environment.

### **Option 1: Using XAMPP / WAMP / MAMP**

1. Copy this folder into the server’s web directory:

   - XAMPP: `htdocs/`
   - WAMP: `www/`
   - MAMP: `htdocs/`

2. Start Apache (and MySQL if needed).
3. Open a browser and visit:

   ```
   http://localhost/<folder-name>/
   ```

### **Option 2: Using the Built-in PHP Server**

If you have PHP installed on your machine:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open:

```
http://localhost:8000/
```
